> This guide applies to the PC and Quest versions of Gorilla Tag and doesn't require a modified version of the game.  

## Loading Maps
In game, head to the arcade map and look into one of the VR arcade machines, You should see a count-down. When the count down ends, you will have entered the virtual stump! You may need to accept the Mod.io terms of service. Just to the right you should see something on the wall saying "PRESS THE 'TERMINAL CONTROL' BUTTON TO PROCEED.", follow the instructions and you'll see a list of maps that looks like this:

![Map Loader Terminal](../docs/files/maploaderterminal.png)

You can press enter on a map to see more details. If you'd like to load it, press enter again to download if you haven't already and press enter to load it, wait for the "Map loaded!" confirmation. After that, you can walk putside the stump to join a lobby! Monke!

## Installing Maps

Right now there isn't any easy way to install maps that haven't officially been added to the loader, however, on occasion people may ask for testing in the [Gorilla Tag Modding Group](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv), once you download the map, you can play it by connecting your mod.io account with the link panel:

Then press option on the terminal to see your downloaded maps!

## Public Lobbies & Custom Maps

?> Although you're normally not supposed to use mods in public lobbies, the in-game map-loader has a built in solution that matchmakes you with other people in that map! These lobbies are inaccessable unless you're in the virtual stump.
