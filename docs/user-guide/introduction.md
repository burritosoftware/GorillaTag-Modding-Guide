### What can you do with mods?

You can:
- Customize your gorilla with custom materials, infected materials, hats, and holdables with [*Custom Cosmetics*](https://github.com/wryser/CustomCosmetics)
- Use custom shirts, badges and more with [*Gorilla Shirts*](https://github.com/developer9998/GorillaShirts)
- Get a variety of mods all with the press of a button with [*GorillaWatch*](https://github.com/ArtificialGorillas/GorillaWatch)
- Change the background of the gorilla computer with [*Computer Backgrounds*](https://github.com/Striker-67/computer-backgrounds)

There are *many more mods* to discover, and you'll find them in the **Downloads** category on the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv).

### Is modding the game safe?

Modding the game is allowed by the developers of Gorilla Tag, however keep in mind the following:

!> All mods carry the risk of getting banned. Though you should be fine as long as you're using trusted mods, note that the use of mods that interfere with gameplay inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to modded lobbies. **Most gameplay-changing mods automatically disable joining public lobbies, but please be careful.**

### End Goal

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Gorilla Tag installation from vanilla to modded with BepInEx.
