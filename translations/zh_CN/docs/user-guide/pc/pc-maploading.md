> This guide only applies to the PC version of Gorilla Tag.  
> If you're using a Quest (without Link), go to the [**Quest Custom Maps Installation**](quest-maploading) guide.

?> `.gtmap` files are cross compatible between PC and Quest, so you can crossplay with your friends, on any platform!

## Installing Maps
!> **Make sure to install the Monke Map Loader mod!** You can download it from the [**Monke Mod Manager**](pc-guide#monke-mod-manager).

?> **Don't have the Monke Mod Manager?** Check out the guide to install it [here](pc-guide#monke-mod-manager)!

Once you've installed the Monke Map Loader, you can install custom maps (`.gtmap` files) into your `Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/plugins/MonkeMapLoader/CustomMaps` folder.

If you don't know where your Gorilla Tag folder is, there's instructions on how to find it [here](pc-guide#install-folder).

**Not sure where to download more custom maps?** Head to [monkemaphub.com](https://monkemaphub.com), where you can find all released maps for the map loader. Click the logo below to head there! Click the logo below to head there!

## Public Lobbies & Custom Maps

?> Although you're normally not supposed to use mods in public matches, the Monke Map Loader implements a special solution that make it OK to do. When you select a custom map and join a public match by going through the teleporter, you're actually joining a private match that matchmakes you with other people playing that map. It's only possible to join these matches if you have the Monke Map Loader installed, so joining public matches is not only fine, but recommended.
